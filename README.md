 Lab Submissions for 50.033 Foundations of Game Design and Development

 # Week 2
 Checkoff requirement: 
 
 - Question Box and Brick
 - Spawn coin 

For this week's lab checkoff, we implemented camera movement, and the animation for the Question Box and Brick when Mario hits it from the bottom.

We created 3 new scripts (yes, we plan to clean it up but for the sake of the checkoff and submission we had no time to fix or have a centralized script for now T^T)

1. `QnMarkBox.cs`
2. `SpawnCoin.cs`
3. `SpringyBox.cs`
